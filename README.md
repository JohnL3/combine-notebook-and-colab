* Json file
* You need a tool to "see" this file as as set of cells, either text or code cells
* It is language agnostic and it supports execution environments (aka kernels) in several dozen languages among which are Julia, R, Haskell, Ruby, and Python
* When you run a notebook, you create a session
* You can create and share documents/notebooks that contain live code, visualizations and narrative text.

* Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows you to run jupyter notebook, so you can write and **execute python live code** in the browser.
* It is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education.
* Offers GPU and TPU


# combine jupyter notebook and colab

* how to create a notebook?
* how to run a notebook at colab?
* how to connect a colab session to the repo? (so you can push files and save notebook changes)
   * in reality we are providing a notebook template with the code for cloning/connecting, the student would copy and past this template and rename it
   * how to push a file from colab session to repo?
   * how to save a notebook at colab?
* see lesson format example
   * for a lesson we wouldnt need to clone the repo and connect the session to the repo, since to save the notebook you just go to file -> save
* see lesson content
* see challenge section and discuss how to unit test
   * open notebook as raw file and look for "challenges" cell
